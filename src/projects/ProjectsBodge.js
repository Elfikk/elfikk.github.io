The experiment is effectively trying to find minima of a non-trivial 600-dimensional parameter space, which lets us estimate physical neutrino parameters. Classic optimisation algorithms like gradient-descent struggle, due to the amount of local minima within the space; Monte Carlo methods are currently used, though this still has issues i.e with dealing with discrete paramaters within the dimensions. The T2K group is therefore experimenting with class of optimisers known as swarm-based algorithms, algorithms are quote on quote inspired by natural phenomena, employing a large number of agents exploring a space via some form of heuristic to try and find the minimum. I looked at an algorithm which is motivated by wolf-hunting behaviour, Grey Wolf Optimisation (GWO). I implemented the algorithm in Python, tested it on different test functions in low dimensions to understand its behaviour, and then implemented it in C++ to run on the T2K computing clusters.",

I was one of the few people on the ML subteam, developing a Random Forest approach to the classification problem (signal against background), though we eventually settled on a Boosted Decision Tree developed by a teammate - as other groups, we found it to breed better results after hyperparameter tuning. In weekly meetings with the wider groups, I relayed the ML teams progress and explained concepts, which made me the ideal candidate for presenting the Machine Learning section in our 30 minute presentation given to the other groups doing the project that term - the first and last time I presented to well over 100 people (I loved it).",

Generally all these phenomena come about on very small scales, with very few particles involves; it's therefore interesting to know there is an effect in water where waves act a bit like particles. This phenomenon of 'solitons' occurs in bodies of water, where two phenomena balance each other giving stable wave peaks travelling through water; these are highly localised (have a tiny, constant width compared to their travel distances) and travel undisturbed.

An interesting application is in topic analysis; an article can be broken down into a proportion of times any given word appears within it. These proportion vectors can be put into a matrix, and once broken down into a multiplicative form, we retrieve d topics from the articles, and a break down of how much each article is about a certain topic. I built a proof of concept article recommender using this algorithm; using BeautifulSoup, I scraped articles from Sky News, performed NNMF on them to extract topics and then used a system of remembering a user's acceptance and rejections of recommendations to inform subsequent recommendations. I then added the functionality for a text-to-speech reading of the article once an article was accepted.",

By being careful to follow at least the Single Responsibility Principle from SOLID at all times, I made it very easy to expand the game for myself; by using Adapter objects I was able to transform the backend's outputs to simple front-end ones, and then to write some game solvers. I initially attempted to train a DeepQ deep learning agent, to solve the game with tensorflow2, having made it work with a simple game of blackjack. However, I found performance was poor, and eventually stumbled onto a paper which made it abundantly clear that my model would need an incredible amount of training to even be able to solve the simplest boards (think 500k games to get a 5x5 grid working - extremely wasteful compute time). I decided to solve the game algorithmically instead; I found a paper which presented the problem as a simultaneous equations. Using Gaussian Elimination and backtracing I was then able to make an algorithm which can handle all solvable games, and then added a heuristic to allow for the algorithm guessing.",

As part of a group of 4, we wrote a raytracing algorithm to visualise optical systems, with the end goal of the project potentially being able to visualise a rainbow. The idea of a raytracer is incredibly simple; rather than shooting out light from a source like a lamp or the Sun, we go backwards from a view. We define a viewport, and for each pixel on its plane we shoot a ray out, bounce it in the environment to determine its colour and intensity up to some maximum depth. Our raytracer handled reflection and refraction, with refraction being wavelength based, which allowed us to visualise chromatic abberation, though with a slightly dodgy colour display. Ultimately, the raytracer was not able to show us a rainbow, but we made some stunning visuals in the process that we could compare to what's out there! My favourite is displayed on the right, where we put a glass sphere in front of a small blue one and a bigger pink one - we can see the reflection and refraction effects display here very clearly.",

There was a easy enough way to formulate these questions though, and the process could be broken down into a question involving a 3D matrix and vectors between certain points. I wrote Point, Vector and 3D Matrix classes to write out an algorithm which solved this for arbitrary lines, allowing me to practice more - it probably doesn't get nerdier than that, but it was an incredibly useful tool for revision at the time.
